Customized symbols, footprints and 3D models for my personal KiCad projects. Completely open and free for anyone to use - at own risk.Â This project is released under [GNU General Public License v3.0](/LICENSE).

## My 3D models

The models are made in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) and exported as KiCad-importable STEP  or WRL files. These are located in the [/espena/3dmodels](/espena/3dmodels) directory.

The models can also be downloaded from my profile on [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/espen.andersen-1).
